## cbindgen integration

Corrosion offers an experimental integration of generating bindings via cbindgen.
This is not available on a stable released version yet, and the details are subject to change.
{{#include ../../cmake/Corrosion.cmake:corrosion_cbindgen}}

### Current limitations

- The current version regenerates the bindings more often then necessary to be on the safe side.
